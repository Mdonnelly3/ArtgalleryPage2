                <div class='details'>This was a painting I created for my mom.
                    It was painting based on a photo I took from Sanibel Island, FL.
                    It was our familys favorite trip.

                <div class='details'>This was a painting I created when I started 
                    experimenting more with abstract art. I based it on the 
                    emotions I had at the time. I felt as though my family was watching every move I made regarding my future closely, and it
                    caused a lot of anxiety. I just wanted to do what made me happiest. The painting can be seen
                    as either the colors being pulled from the hand into the darkness, or the colors 
                    filling the hand as it touches them, for a more postive view.

                <div class='details'>This is a painting of my happy place. The Apostle Islands.
                    My best friend, brother and I went on a camping trip. The camping was a 
                    complete disaster, but I took from it some of the funniest, happiest memories 
                    Ive ever made. Everytime I look at the painting, I see us all on the beach,
                    no place to sleep, but laughing with our toes in the sand, just watching the sun 
                    set together.

                <div class='details'>I Love to paint on unique objects, and try to give them
                    a story behind each one. This was a painting I did on a sanddollar that I 
                    found walking along the beach.

                    the other one I did, and gifted me this sanddollar to paint as well.
                    She found it on the beach while on a trip with my papa. It brings her 
                    happy memories.
